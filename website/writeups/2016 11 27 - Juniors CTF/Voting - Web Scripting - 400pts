The principle of the challenge is really simple. You have to obtain more than 250 upvotes to get the flag. But each user can vote once.

So to solve this challenge you just have to create 250 users activate them (a user is activated using a link sent by mail) and vote for the same user. Then you just login with this user and get the flag.

## The normal way

I've started to put all the pieces together, use the Google gmail API to get the mail and activate the user. A captcha is required on register but the answer of the captcha is in the HTML source code.

So I had all the pieces to launch my exploit and was ready to go. Then I thought a little bit and came out with another (funnier) way to solve the challenge...

## The hacker way

As you see, solving this challenge is quite straight-forward and when you start to write your exploit you have to choose a random username/email/password. What I used was :

```python
rndm = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase + string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits) for _ in range(N))
username = rndm
password = rndm
email = "myname+" + rndm + "@hugodelval.com"
```

Then I thought that somebody might already have writen this code before me and created a user with a password==username ?? Maybe this user already have (upvotes > 250) and then already have the flag ?

So I looked for all the users who have more than 250 upvotes and tried their username as their password, and indeed it worked ! Thanks to the user **ttt** for providing me with the flag ;)
